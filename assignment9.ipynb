For compression/decompression the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used. XZ Utils started as a Unix port of Igor Pavlov\\'s LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior.\\n\\n\\n== Features ==\\nXZ Utils can compress and decompress the xz and lzma file formats. Since the LZMA format has been considered legacy,\\nXZ Utils by default compresses to xz.\\nIn most cases, xz achieves higher compression rates than alternatives like zip, gzip and bzip2. Decompression speed is higher than bzip2, but lower than gzip. Compression can be much slower than gzip, and is slower than bzip2 for high levels of compression, and is most useful when a compressed file will be used many times.\\nXZ Utils consists of two major components:\\n\\nxz, the command-line compressor and decompressor (analogous to gzip)\\nliblzma, a software library with an API similar to zlib\\nVarious command shortcuts exist, such as lzma (for xz --format=lzma), unxz (for xz --decompress; analogous to gunzip) and xzcat (for unxz --stdout; analogous to zcat).\\n\\n\\n== Usage ==\\nBoth the behavior of the software and the properties of the file format have been designed to work similarly to those of the popular Unix compressing tools gzip and bzip2.\\nJust like gzip and bzip, xz and lzma can only compress single files (or data streams) as input. They cannot bundle multiple files into a single archive –  to do this an archiving program is used first, such as tar.\\nCompressing an archive:\\n\\nDecompressing the archive:\\n\\nVersion 1.22 or greater of the GNU implementation of tar has transparent support for tarballs compressed with lzma and xz, using the switches --xz or -J for xz compression, and --lzma for LZMA compression.\\nCreating an archive and compressing it:\\n\\nDecompressing the archive and extracting its contents:\\n\\nSingle-letter tar example for archive with compress and decompress with extract using short suffix:\\n\\nxz has supported multi-threaded compression (with the -T flag) since 2014, version 5.2.0; since version 5.4.0 threaded decompression has been implemented. Threaded decompression requires multiple compressed blocks within a stream which are created by the threaded compression interface. The number of threads can be less than defined if the file is not big enough for threading with the given settings or if using more threads would exceed the memory usage limit.\\n\\n\\n== The xz format ==\\nThe xz format improves on lzma by allowing for preprocessing filters. The exact filters used are similar to those used in 7z, as 7z\\'s filters are available in the public domain via the LZMA SDK.\\n\\n\\n== Development and adoption ==\\nDevelopment of XZ Utils took place within the Tukaani Project, a small group of developers who once maintained a Linux distribution based on Slackware. The chosen name \"XZ\" is not an abbreviation but instead appears to be a random given name for the data compressors, as there is no mention anywhere in the official specification on the meaning of \"XZ\".\\nThe .xz file format specification version 1.0.0 was officially released in January 2009.\\nAll of the source code for xz and liblzma has been released into the public domain. The XZ Utils source distribution additionally includes some optional scripts and an example program that are subject to various versions of the GNU General Public License (GPL). The resulting software xz and liblzma binaries are public domain, unless the optional LGPL getopt implementation is incorporated.\\nBinaries are available for FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux systems, Microsoft Windows, and FreeDOS. A number of Linux distributions, including Fedora, Slackware, Ubuntu, and Debian use xz for compressing their software packages.
